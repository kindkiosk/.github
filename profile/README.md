## Hi there 👋

[Kind Kiosk](https://kindkiosk.com) is a company built to help nonprofits of all sizes elevate in-person donations. 
We offer temporary kiosks for events like galas and conferences, or dedicated kiosks for offices, museums, animal welfare or faith-based organizations.
Our kiosks are shipped fully configured and are offered in full-size, table mount, and handheld options.

If that sounds interesting to you, reach out! We'd love to tell you about it.

Check out the [Nonprofit Conference Directory](https://nonprofitconferencedirectory.com) - a site we built to help you figure out the nonprofit conferences you want to attend.

We've got a ton of great stuff in the works, and should have some Github repo's in the near future.

Be Kind!
